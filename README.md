# 🚦 Traffic Prediction Web App  
A machine learning-based web application built using **Flask** to predict traffic conditions based on various inputs like date, weather, and special occasions. The model uses **Random Forest / Deep Learning (N-BEATS)** for accurate predictions.  

## 🚀 Features  
- 📊 Predicts traffic for a given date.  
- 🌦 Takes weather conditions and special occasions into account.  
- 📉 Displays results in a **graph format** over 24 hours.  
- 🎨 **Bootstrap-based UI** with an intuitive user interface.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  
- **Backend:** Flask, Python  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS (Bootstrap)  
- **Machine Learning:** Random Forest / Deep Learning (N-BEATS)  
- **Deployment:** Ngrok (for Colab testing)
